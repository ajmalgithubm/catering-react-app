Here's a breakdown of the main features and components of the app:

# Food Category Component:
This component displays a list of food categories fetched from the API. It acts as a menu to help users explore different cuisines and meal types.

# Food List Component:
This component lists the meals available in a selected food category. It fetches the data from the API based on the chosen category and displays the meals with their names and images.

# Recipe Component:
This component shows the details of a selected meal, such as the recipe, cooking instructions, and a video demonstrating the cooking process. The required ingredients for the recipe are also listed.

# API Integration: 
The app fetches data from the provided API using asynchronous JavaScript calls (e.g., using fetch or an external library like Axios). The fetched data is then used to populate the components and display the relevant information to the user.

Here's a simplified example of how the code structure might look like:
